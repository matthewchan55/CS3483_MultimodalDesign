# CS3483

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many places for doing sports like gym rooms and sports
grounds were closed due to government policies. People can only work out on their own at
home. Without any supervision from gym instructors, it is common for people to execute the
wrong exercise posture. It may decrease the effectiveness of the action. What is more,
performing the wrong postures may cause health problems and injuries. To improve the
effectiveness and safety of doing sports at home, we would like to design a web application
to help track the correctness of the actions when the users are doing sports.
The user community of the application would be the public in all age groups who would like
to exercise at home. Here are the characteristics of the community and the points that have
to be noticed when designing the application in order to provide a smooth and convenient
experience for the users of the application.
